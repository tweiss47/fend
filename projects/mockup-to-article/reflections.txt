You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

It's been a good start so far. As far as new skills go.
  * I've gotten comfortable with a new editing environment, Atom. I set it up
    display markdown and added a couple of packages to help with html editing
    that have been really useful.
  * I've managed to get a basic familiarity with a collection of html tags and
    get some practice using them.
  * I've gotten comfortable navigating the course and handing in assignments.

What has been easy? Most things. The course content and navigation works really
well and the material so far has been pretty strait forward. None of it is
completely new to me at this point.

What has been difficult? Nothing yet. The pace of the course has been fine and
I'm still in the honeymoon stage, having just signed up, so I feel like I'm
making good progress and am finding the time to work on the course.

As far as problem solving strategies, there hasn't been much of a need at this
point. I've done some outside reading and used MDN as a reference when I
haven't know how to address a problem immediately.
